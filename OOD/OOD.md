# 3 Important Concepts of OOD
1. Information hiding : object should not know about other objects' data representation
	- Don't need to know how other objects work if not relevant
2. Interfaces : line b/w client and provider 
	- Client still knows steering wheel is a steering wheel even if the design changes
3. Polymorphism : same code works on different types of objects

*Loosely-couple* : different parts of a program depend as little as possible on the details of other parts

## Functional vs OOD
*Functional Design Pattern*
- Data representations, then behaviors
- Pro: Adding new functions/behaviors is easy
- Con: Adding new data types is cumbersome

*Object-oreinted design*
- Behaviors then data representation
- Pro: Adding new data types is easy
- Con: Adding new functions/behaviors is cumbersome
