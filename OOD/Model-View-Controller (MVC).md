System is in 3 parts: 
- Should be independent of one another
	- Must implement loose coupling
	- Model <=> Controller
	- Controller <=> View

# Controller
*Take user input and decide what to do*


# View
*Dispay an interface to the user*

# Model
*Domain-specific information that the user can manipulate*
- Holds the data for the system
- Enforce the integrity of the data - operating correctly
- How to manipulate the data
