Problem : I need a way to redirect my own input into a class for testing or redirect a class' output to something for testing

1st: Use an inputStream to send our String to class for testing. Use and outputsteram to get the output of the class we are testing

2nd: Use a Readable to send out String to class for testing. Use an Appendable to get the outpout of the class we are testing - **PREFERED**
